Code Explanation

1. Mini Games Project (Number Guessing & Rock-Paper-Scissors)

Number Guessing:

Imports the random module.

Generates a random number between 1 and 10.

Allows the player 3 attempts to guess the number.

Provides feedback on each guess ("Congrats", "Incorrect").

If the player fails after 3 attempts, reveals the correct number.

Rock-Paper-Scissors:

Defines the possible choices.

Keeps track of the scores for player 1 and player 2.

The game continues until one player reaches a score of 2.

Prompts each player to enter their choice.

Validates the input.

Determines the winner of each round.

Updates the scores.

Prints the score after each round.

Declares the overall winner.

2. Lagrange Interpolation

Lagrange Interpolation Function:

Takes lists of x values, y values (f(x)), and the xp value (the x-value at which to interpolate) as input.

Implements the Lagrange interpolation formula.

Returns the interpolated yp value.

Input and Output:

Prompts the user to enter the x values, y values, and the xp value.

Error handling is added to ensure x and y lists have the same length.

Calls the lagrange_interpolation function.

Prints the interpolated y value.

3. Account Class

Account Class:

The class stores account information (account number, name, type, balance).

__init__: The constructor initializes the attributes.

calculate_balance: Calculates the final balance based on the interest rate applicable to the account type.

saving: 2.70% interest.

fixed_deposit: 7.0% interest.

Raises ValueError for invalid account types.

__str__: Returns a formatted string representation of the account details (including the calculated balance).

Example Usage:

Prints the details of each account, which automatically calls the __str__ method.

4. Family Budget

Represents a family member with their name, age, role, and contribution to the family income.

__str__: Returns a formatted string representation of the family member's details.

FamilyBudget Class:
